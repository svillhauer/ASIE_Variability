## Research Overview
### Understanding Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Variability
Antarctic sea ice extent is influenced by various climatic and oceanic factors. This repository examines:
- Annual minimum and maximum sea ice extent
- Time of advance and retreat
- Regional differences across Antarctic sectors
- Long-term trends and inter-annual variability

### Key Findings:
- The Weddell Sea sector exhibits a trend of earlier advance.  
- The Ross and Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas show opposing trends in retreat timing.  
- Variability in advance and retreat correlates with mesoscale atmospheric circulation patterns.

## Code
### MATLAB Scripts in `/Code/`
#### Key scripts:
- `annual_cycle_analysis.m` – Decomposes ASIE into its major components.
- `sector_comparisons.m` – Evaluates inter-regional correlations.
- `trend_analysis.m` – Computes linear trends in ASIE variability.
