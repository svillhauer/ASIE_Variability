## Research Overview
### Goal: Understanding Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Variability
Antarctic sea ice extent is influenced by various climatic and oceanic factors. This repository examines:
- Annual minimum and maximum sea ice extent
- Time of advance and retreat
- Regional differences across Antarctic sectors
- Long-term trends and inter-annual variability

### Key Findings:
- The Weddell Sea sector exhibits a trend of earlier advance.  
- The Ross and Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas show opposing trends in retreat timing.  
- Variability in advance and retreat correlates with mesoscale atmospheric circulation patterns.
